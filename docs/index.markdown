### Fall 2026

If you are reading this webpage as a prospective advisor in the Fall 2026 PhD application cycle, I want to assert that I am **very motivated** to finish a PhD for my future career goals, and have no intention of stopping at a MS.

I gave a talk for the **Security & Privacy Research @ Illinois Seminar** about our recent work, *Efficiently attacking memorization scores*. I was very nervous...

Submitted my first ever first-author paper to **ICLR 2026**! *Efficiently attacking memorization scores* is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20463). We motivate the need for robust algorithms in data markets by theoretically and empirically demonstrating the vulnerability of memorization functions to adversarial attack in the supervised learning setting. In particular, we demonstrate that inverse-based queries raise memorization scoring significantly higher than simple out-of-distribution attacks, suggesting an underlying informational component to memorization, and subsequently generalization, that goes beyond the common intuition of distributional shifts. Thanks to my advisors Daniel Alabi and Varun Chandrasekaran for guiding me through my first research project from start to finish.
