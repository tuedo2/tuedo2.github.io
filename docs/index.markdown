Submitted my first ever first-author paper to NeurIPS 2025! *MemAttack: Efficiently attacking memorization scores* coming soon to an arXiv near you! We motivate the need for robust algorithms in data markets by theoretically and empirically demonstrating the vulnerability of data influence functions to adversarial attack. Thanks to my wonderful advisor Varun Chandrasekaran and our brilliant collaborator Daniel Alabi for guiding me through my first research project start to finish.
