I am currently an MS/PhD Student and Teaching Assistant for the ECE Department at UIUC. I have a passion for teaching and research. I am generally interested in randomized algorithms, particularly those pertaining to privacy-preservation. I am very fortunate to be currently advised by [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Outside of my academic pursuits I enjoy playing volleyball and working on the next biggest album (Soon<sup>TM</sup>).
