I am currently an MS/PhD Student and Teaching Assistant for the ECE Department at UIUC. I am currently interested in researching algorithms and guarantees for differential privacy in the context of learning algorithms; in other words I want to prevent Google from knowing everything about me. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
