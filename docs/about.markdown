I am currently a second-year PhD Student at the ECE Department at UIUC. I have a strong passion for both teaching and research. I am generally interested in theoretical explanations for machine learning phenomena, with a focus on privacy implications. I am very fortunate to be currently advised by [Daniel Alabi](https://alabidan.me){:target="_blank"} and [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://chandrasekaran-group.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. Outside of my academic pursuits I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, and working on the next biggest album (Soon<sup>TM</sup>).
