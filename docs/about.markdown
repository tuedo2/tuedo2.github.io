I am currently an MS/PhD Student and Teaching Assistant for the ECE Department at UIUC. My current research spans fundamental learning theory, specifically in regards to transformer models. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Varun Chandrasekaran](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chandrasekaran/){:target="_blank"}.
